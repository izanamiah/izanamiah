I'm a software engineer with the following interests;
- Modern artificial intelligence, exploits computation and data as a lens to explore machine intelligence.
- Full-stack software development as a way of packaging intelligence to deliver service and experience as value created for end users.

My past experience involving:
- Theoretical foundation of Statistics, Probability and Optimization from graduate study in Operations Research & Financial Engineering at Princeton University
- Practical hands-on in mechanics and manufacturing from undergraduate study in Industrial Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology

I now spend most of my time coding on exciting projects. Outside my work, I love creating cool 3D models with Blender while exploring their potential in AR/VR. I listen to J-Pop and play a guitar.
