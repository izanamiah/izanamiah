I'm an engineer with the following interests:
- Modern artificial intelligence, exploits computation and data as a lens to explore machine intelligence.
- Full-stack software development as a way of packaging intelligence to deliver service and experience as value created for end users.
- Distributed service architecture that scales to serve more people and create more value.

My past experiences involving:
- Theoretical foundation of Statistics, Probability and Optimization from graduate study in Operations Research & Financial Engineering at Princeton University (2017-2019)
- Knowledge of mechanics, manufacturing and supply chain from undergraduate study in Industrial Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology (2014-2017)

I now spend most of my time coding on exciting projects with <img height="35" width="35" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/go/00ADD8">&nbsp; <img height="25" width="25" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/typescript/3178C6">&nbsp; <img height="25" width="25" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/swift/F05138">&nbsp;<img height="25" width="25" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/react/61DAFB">. Outside my work, I love creating cool 3D models with <img height="25" width="25" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/blender/E87D0D"> while exploring their potential in AR/VR. I listen to J-Pop and play a guitar.
